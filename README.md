# BlenderVault

BlenderVault is a research-oriented, open-source (free) design tool inspired by RhinoVAULT, 
developed to explore compression-only vaulted structures using form-finding 
and triangulation-based methods within a Blender-based environment.

## Research Motivation
This project explores compression-only vaulted structures as a sustainable 
alternative to material-intensive construction systems, with applications 
in low-energy architecture and extraterrestrial habitats.

## Research Context
The research investigates digital form-finding techniques for sustainable 
masonry and additively manufactured (3D-printed) vault structures, bridging 
architectural design, structural logic, and computational workflows.

## Scientific Positioning
This project is conceptually inspired by Thrust Network Analysis (TNA) and 
RhinoVAULT, reinterpreted and extended within an open-source Blender environment 
to support experimental, design-driven research.

## Method Overview
- User-defined base points (empties / vertex groups)
- Triangulation-based mesh generation
- Height-controlled form-finding
- Early force-density logic (prototype stage)

## Features
- Base points defined via **Vertex Groups**
- Triangulated mesh generation
- Fan subdivision (rectangular subdivision)
- Global height control
- Early-stage form-finding logic
- Color-graded force visualization

## Current Status
Prototype / ongoing research project (initiated in 2022).

## Future Research Directions
- Integration of structural analysis and feedback
- Optimization under material and fabrication constraints
- Robotic and digital fabrication workflows
- Application to lunar and Martian habitat systems

## Usage
1. Download the BlenderVault add-on and save it on your computer (Windows only at the moment).
2. In Blender, go to **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → Install from Disk**.
3. Install the add-on.
4. Press **N** in the 3D Viewport; *Folding Vault II* appears in the sidebar.
5. Design your base mesh.
6. Define anchors as **Vertex Groups**.
7. Select the base mesh using the FoldingVault II eyedropper tool.
8. Adjust parameters and explore form-finding results.
