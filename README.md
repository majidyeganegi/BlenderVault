# BlenderVault

BlenderVault is a research-oriented design open-source (free) tool inspired by RhinoVAULT, 
developed to explore compression-only vaulted structures using form-finding 
and triangulation-based methods.

## Publicatiob:
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18547295
This is part of a broader project to revive arched structures for contemporary/future uses.
Please have a look at my book: Skybound Structures: https://a.co/d/0gkV4E7F

## Research Motivation
This project explores compression-only vaulted structures as a sustainable 
alternative to material-intensive construction systems, with applications 
in low-energy architecture and extraterrestrial habitats.

## Research Context
This project investigates digital form-finding techniques for sustainable 
masonry and 3D-printed vault structures.

## Scientific Positioning
This project is inspired by Thrust Network Analysis (TNA) and RhinoVAULT,
reinterpreted within an open-source Blender environment.

## Method Overview
- User-defined base points (empties)
- Triangulation-based mesh generation
- Height-controlled form-finding
- Early force-density logic (prototype)

## Features
- Base points defined by "Vertex Groups."
- Triangulated mesh generation
- Fan subdivision (rectangular subdivision)
- Height control
- Early-stage form-finding logic
- Color-grading force visualisation

## Current Status
Prototype / ongoing research project.(started in 2022)

## Future Research Directions
- Integration of structural analysis
- Optimization under material constraints
- Robotic fabrication workflows
- Application to lunar and Martian habitats

## Usage:
1- Download the RhinoVault add-on and save it on your computer (Windows only at the moment)
Installation: In Blender3D, go to Preferences --> install from disk. 
Press "N", "Folding Vault II, appears inside the main 3D space.
Design your base mesh, set "anchors" as "vertext groups".
Chose the base mesh unsing the eyedropper tool of the FoldingVault II. 
Play with parameters.
