# BlenderVault

BlenderVault is a research-oriented design open-source (free) tool inspired by RhinoVAULT, 
developed to explore compression-only vaulted structures using form-finding 
and triangulation-based methods.

## Research Context
This project investigates digital form-finding techniques for sustainable 
masonry and 3D-printed vault structures.

## Features
- Base points defined by empties
- Triangulated mesh generation
- Height control
- Early-stage form-finding logic

## Current Status
Prototype / ongoing research project.
